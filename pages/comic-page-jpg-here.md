In case you missed the README: to keep the repository "lightweight" it don't contains the comic pages themself on this folder.
You can download your language comic pages here [http://www.peppercarrot.com/en/static6/sources&page=download](http://www.peppercarrot.com/en/static6/sources&page=download), and extract the content (all jpg pages) into this ```pages``` folder. 
Then remove lang prefix (```en_, fr_, it_``` etc.) from all files names.

*To do: a script to rename files*
